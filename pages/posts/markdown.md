# Start

If your Python/Javascript Discord Bot is already built then you can make do some changes in that Repl to make it run for 24 Hours or you can start from Scratch.

## Step 1

First, upload your discord bot files to replit using github. You can view this documentation to know more about upload/importing github repositories - [**Replit Docs**](https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/06-github-and-run-button)

### Step 2

Once your done uploading your files from github to replit, go ahead and click on the ``run`` button, this will run your discord bot and make it online.

### Step 3

After the bot goes online, copy the webserver link and head over to uptimerobot. Once you head over to uptimerobot, make an account and verify it. You will be then redirected to your dashboard, where you will see the `create monitor` option. Click it, now you will see a pop-up where you will see the following options:- 

1. Monitor Type
For this option, select HTTP because we are going to be using the webserver link

2. Friendly Name
The 'Friendly Name' is just an option to write any [**name**](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj4-LWP_PTzAhXZfn0KHQiYAzMQ3yx6BAgDEAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DxvFZjo5PgG0&usg=AOvVaw1bR_FN-SnfIGtKD3fjAA5P), more of a label

3. URL (or IP)
This is where you will be adding the webserver link, through this we will be keeping it online for 24/7

Your done, rest of the options should be kept as it is (Default) and not to be changed. Just click the `create monitor` option below and your bot is online for 24/7
