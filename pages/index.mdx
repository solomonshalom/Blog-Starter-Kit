# Solomon Shalom Lijo

Hey, I'm Solomon Shalom Lijo. I am a middle school student, game and front-end developer living in india. 

I enjoy working with Next.js and crafting beautiful front-end experiences. I also work with python and javascript, 
but I am more of a front-end guy. 

[**My Projects**](https://github.com/solomonshalom?tab=repositories) - to get a know a little about what I make and get you an idea. Hope you like it
