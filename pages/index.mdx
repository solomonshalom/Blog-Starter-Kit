# Solomon Shalom Lijo

Hey, I'm Solomon Shalom Lijo. I am a middle school student, game and front-end developer living in india. 

I enjoy working with Next.js and crafting beautiful front-end experiences. I also work with python and javascript, 
but I am more of a front-end guy. 

Currently I am working with few clients to make cutting-edge websites and I am also working on my start-up (Blindr) on the side as well. 
Feel free to contact me through my socials for any help or client-work

[**My Projects**](https://github.com/solomonshalom?tab=repositories) - to get a know a little about what I make and get you an idea. Hope you like it
